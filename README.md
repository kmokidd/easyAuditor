# easyAuditor

If you are short at jQuery or JavaScript but want to add some music in your project, then you are in the right place. **easyAuditor** is a very easy [jQuery plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/) to enable audio used on the Internet. But it **requries modern browsers**, so if the users' browser is under IE10, this plugin will not work normally.
